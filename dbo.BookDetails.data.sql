Rosen ', N'DiscreteMathematics_Applications.jpg', N'"Discrete Mathematics and its Applications" is a focused introduction to the primary themes in a discrete mathematics course, as introduced through extensive applications, expansive discussion, and detailed exercise sets. These themes include mathematical reasoning, combinatorial analysis, discrete structures, algorithmic thinking, and enhanced problem-solving skills through modeling. Its intent is to demonstrate the relevance and practicality of discrete mathematics to all students. The fifth edition includes a more thorough and linear presentation of logic, proof types and proof writing, and mathematical reasoning. This enhanced coverage will provide students with a solid understanding of the material as it relates to their immediate field of study and other relevant subjects. The inclusion of applications and examples to key topics has been significantly addressed to add clarity to every subject. True to the fourth edition, the text-specific web site supplements the subject matter in meaningful ways, offering additional material for students and instructors. Discrete math is an active subject with new discoveries made every year. The continual growth and updates to the web site reflect the active nature of the topics being discussed. The book is appropriate for a one- or two-term introductory discrete mathematics course to be taken by students in a wide variety of majors, including computer science, mathematics, and engineering. College Algebra is the only explicit prerequisite.', 20, N'DISMAT', N'ALL', N'2018-02-03 14:56:50', N'2018-02-03 14:56:50')

Terms are clearly defined when they are introduced, basic material appears toward the beginning of each chapter and is explained carefully and in detail, and numerical examples are used to introduce and suggest general results. Simple practice problems appear throughout each chapter, while more difficult problems appear at the ends of chapters, following the order of presentation of text material. This introduction and resulting repetition provide an important boost to the learning process. Hayt''s rich pedagogy supports and encourages the student throughout by offering tips and warnings, using design to highlight key material, and providing lots of opportunities for hands-on learning. The thorough exposition of topics is delivered in an informal way that underscores the authors’ conviction that circuit analysis can and should be fun.', 7, N'BEE', N'EEE', N'2018-02-03 15:31:13', N'2018-02-03 15:31:13')

As such, this book employs a novel approach to the exposition of the material in which phasors and ac steady-state analysis are introduced at the beginning. This allows one to use phasors in the discussion of transients excited by ac sources, which makes the presentation of transients more comprehensive and meaningful. Furthermore, the machinery of phasors paves the road to the introduction of transfer functions, which are then used in the analysis of transients and the discussion of Bode plots and filters. Another salient feature of the text is the consolidation into one chapter of the material concerned with dependent sources and operational amplifiers. Dependent sources are introduced as linear models for transistors on the basis of small signal analysis. In the text, PSpice simulations are prominently featured to reinforce the basic material and understanding of circuit analysis.', 9, N'BEE', N'EEE', N'2018-02-03 15:34:22', N'2018-02-03 15:34:22')
